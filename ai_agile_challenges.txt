5. No

6. 1. Alignment with Agile Iteration Cycles
AI and machine learning projects often require significant time for data gathering, model training, and validation. This can be at odds with Agile’s preference for short, iterative sprints delivering shippable increments. Teams may struggle to break down complex AI tasks into small enough pieces for each sprint.

2. Data Quality and Availability
AI’s effectiveness hinges on high-quality, relevant data. In Agile, new features and user stories are prioritized for delivery, but if the required data isn’t ready, bottlenecks occur. Cross-functional communication and early data pipeline development become crucial.

3. Cross-Functional Team Skills
Agile teams are ideally cross-functional, but not every team member may have AI/ML expertise. Skill gaps lead to reliance on a few specialists, slowing progress and impacting Agile’s collaboration promise.

4. Uncertain Outcomes
AI projects often come with inherent uncertainty: sometimes, even with the best efforts, models don’t deliver the expected results. This unpredictability challenges Agile planning, estimation, and demo expectations.

5. Integration and Deployment
AI models require special handling in deployment and monitoring compared to regular software. Agile teams may need to adjust DevOps practices (MLOps) to monitor model drift, automate retraining, and ensure seamless releases.
